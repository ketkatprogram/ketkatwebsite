Pretty self-explanatory. If you want to copy or reference my code, even though they're terrible and not optimized, feel free to do so

NOTE: As of 23/12/25, future commits will no longer include images because I'm afraid that I'll get DMCA. I will still include images for buttons and stamps, and I will try to keep proper credits to where I found them.
