      <p><b>hello, welcome to my art gallery! this page will be uploaded manually when theres new art.</b> <br><br>
        i started drawing for fun when i was 7th grade. back then, i dont really care about quality that much because i was just focusing on having fun. unfortunately, i cant show it because i deleted all of them and even burned my old sketchbook. i feel embaressed looking back at it. it wasnt until 2023-2024 that i tried taking art seriously. i started to think about anatomy and making everything realistic. i was improving fast until i was in 8th grade. things slowly went downhill after that. up until that point, i got so focused on trying to make my art look good that i forgot to have fun. my improvement unfortunately kinda slowed there up until today. i still love drawing but i just procasinate rather than actually drawing shit <br><br>
        <b>if you want my advice to be an artist, dont be too focused on making your art perfect.</b> even if it looks like doodoo dogwater, just post it. theres no good art without shit art. do what you want, i guess idk
